            Being surrounded by like-minded peers made myself more motivated than ever and appreciative of the supportive environment that I am in. \
            In addition, LPN is full of unique individuals whom I would have never really gotten to know during my time at UCI and has given me a \
            better sense of the exciting personalities that help me grow as a student and as a person. \
            It has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to be part of such an organization, and I am glad to have been a part of it. ",
