However, Lambda Phi Nu is more than just a fraternity that develops professionalism; The fraternity has helped me discover various facets of myself that I was unaware of and has helped foster personal growth. The fraternity is made up of individuals who I can trust with my life and already feels like home. Seeing the motivated, driven individuals greatly inspires me, and I can confidently say that rushing Lambda Phi Nu was one of the best decisions I have made in college.",
