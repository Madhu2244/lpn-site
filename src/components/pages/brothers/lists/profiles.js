By the end of it, however, I never felt more eager to challenge myself and get out of my comfort zone. Instead of feeling intimidated, I felt inspired being surrounded by so many hardworking individuals. It was one of the few times where I not only felt connected but felt an innate drive to succeed. I knew I wanted to continuously be surrounded by such amazing people and make lasting relationships. To this day, LPN still means a lot to me. I not only developed professionally, but I built up my confidence, learned more about myself than ever before, and truly understood what it means to be part of a family.",
