I then decided to seek a community that shared the same passion for business as I did, but instead, I not only found a community but a family. Lambda Phi Nu is filled with individuals who are committed, determined, and passionate about reaching their full potential, prompting one also to adopt those characteristics and become driven and motivated themselves.",

Along with all the growth I have made professionally, it has been amazing to have a group of people who I can just hang out with or eat with.
